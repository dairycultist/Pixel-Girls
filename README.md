# Pixel Girls [StationAPI]

### Content

- women characters with breasts (not horny bait)
  - custom sounds
  - breasts have custom texture
  - they don't despawn
- women spawn naturally
- you can talk with women (only possible in videogames)

### Women currently in the mod

- Senko (from _The Helpful Fox Senko-San_)
- Koishi (from _Touhou Project_)
- Miku (from _Vocaloid_)
- Sakura Miku (from _Vocaloid_)

### Planned
- badass girls that spawn in the nether
- senko having 3D ears and a big bushy tail
- befriending women by giving them their favourite item
  - "Follow me" / they follow you
  - "Stick around this place" / they wander around, but never get too far from where you told them to stay. good for villages!
- women who you've befriended can be told to do stuff (like the mod Touhou Little Maids, I need to figure out how to do a mouse GUI tho)
- remove sus hurt sounds
- make speech part of translation file
