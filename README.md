# Pixel Girls [StationAPI]

### Features

what if I make fattycraft but it's super wholesome, SIMPLE no need for dialogue or advanced behaviour, just friends :3

- women characters with breasts (not horny bait)
  - breasts have custom texture
  - they don't despawn
- women spawn naturally
- click on a woman to make her follow you, click again to let her wander

### Women currently in the mod

- Senko (from _The Helpful Fox Senko-San_)
- Koishi (from _Touhou Project_)
- Miku (from _Vocaloid_)
- Sakura Miku (from _Vocaloid_)

### Planned

- woman villages
- custom sounds
- refactor to dairycultist.pixelgirls or something
- belly girls
- badass girls that spawn in the nether
- senko having 3D ears and a big bushy tail
